Manufacturing is key stone of the Automotive Industry. What we see today of robotic arms doing the welding and assembling the whole car is contributed by Mr. Henry Ford. Establishing his legacy, the Moving Assembly Line which revolutionise the manufacturing in large scale of production of cars. Presently the car manufacturing as become Smart Factories using of 3D Printer or Additive Manufacturing (AM) of car components. The Czinger is manufacturing with whole 3D printed parts. Thus introducing a excotic car none like Buggati, Koenigsegg or Porsche, thought Proche is the first to 3D print the car components 1990's.

It all began in 2011 Christian von Koenigsegg founder of Koenigsegg did use of Additive Manufacturing for 3D printing seamless rear view mirror and Variable turbo charger. Swedish Engineer took the leap of step in 3D printing of core parts, which is at the embryonic stage of additive manufacturing. THe Varible Turbo Charger is intergration of both Low RPM and High RPM turbo housing is achieved through 3D printing, no welding of two housing, unique monobody housing.

Now back to Czinger after a decade of Koenigsegg accomplishment to Czinger manufacturered 90% components 3D printed car. The Czinger heralding the additive manufacturing to revolutionise the traditional manufacturing. Czinger used generative AI aid human to design components.
