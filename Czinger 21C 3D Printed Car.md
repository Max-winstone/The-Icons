Manufacturing is key stone of the Automotive Industry. What we see today of robotic arms doing the welding and assembling the whole car is contributed by Mr. Henry Ford. Setting up Moving Assembly Line which revolutionise the manufacturing in large scale of cars. Presently the car manufacturing is become Smart Factories using of 3D Printer or Additive Manufacturing (AM). The Czinger is manufacturing with whole AM parts. Thus introducing a excotic car none like Buggati, Koenigsegg or Porsche.

in 2011 Christian von Koenigsegg did use of Additive Manufacturing for seamless rear view mirror and Variable turbo charger. Swedish Engineer took the leap of step in 3D printing of core part, at the embryic stage of AM. Intergration of Low RPM and High RPM turbo housing can be achieved through 3D printing, no welding of two housing.

Now back to Czinger after a decade accomplished to manufacturer whole as 90% 3D printed car. The Czinger heralding the AM to revolutionise the traditional manufacturing. Czinger used generative AI aid human design components.
